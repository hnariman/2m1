Now this is simple TODO file here.

First of all I need to make urgent notes on things to be done tomorrow, in
regard with this project:

- I don't like the table overall
- % of font-size ain't no good either
- [ colorlib theme for the colors ] (https://colorhunt.co/palette/144399)
- I want to change term configuration for bash, and have a nicer theme for vim,
  since this thing is more powerful than VScode overall, and shall look nicer!
- Not all the fields are looking ok ( shall check the tech requirements for the
  project);
